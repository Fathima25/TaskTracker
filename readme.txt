Hi Guys, Since i am making use of Local Storage as Local Database, update,delete and Insert happens in local Storage data Itself. 
So in order to run the application kindly paste the below code in Developer Console(chrome or mozilla):

localStorage.setItem("Admin",'{"Pradeep P":[],"Darshan Sagar L":[{"task":"Search Enhancement"}],"Harish Babu":[{"task":"New Widget Addition"}],"Sahas Chowdry":[{"task":"Generation Changes"}]}');

After running this code kindly refresh the Admin page, you should be able to see few data in the table. SetUp is done :).

Start adding task assign it to team members and keep a track of status.
